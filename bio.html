			I was born in Delhi, the year Lov Grover gave his <i>database search algorithm</i>.
			It was 1996 in case you are still wondering. I grew up watching and playing (like 
			any other Indian kid) cricket. I completed my 10+2 education from Balvantray Mehta 
			Vidya Bhawan, Greater Kailash - II in the year 2014.
			</p>
			<p>
			In the month of August that same year, I started my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from THDC
			Institute of Hydropower Engineering and Technology. The college is in the beautiful 
			city of Tehri in the Uttarakhand state.
			</p>
			<p>My hobbies: reading about various kind of stuff like history, philosophy, Hinduism and a lot more things. 
			I'm a huge fan of electronic music.</p>
			
			<p>Since I started my B.Tech I got interested in problems which have a number theoretic or algebraic flavour. 
			But what really inspired me was a paper called "Primes is in P" originally published in 2002 by three people 
			from IIT Kanpur. The paper was a breakthrough result since it gave first <i>deterministic</i>, <i>unconditional</i>, 
			<i>general</i> <i>polynomial-time</i> algorithm for primality test. And that's not all, out of the 
			three authors, two were undergradautes at the time!</p>

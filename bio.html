			<p><br>
			I was born in Delhi, the year Lov Grover gave his <i>database search algorithm</i>.
			It was 1996 in case you are still wondering. I grew up watching and playing (like 
			any other Indian kid) cricket. I completed my 10+2 education from Balvantray Mehta 
			Vidya Bhawan, Greater Kailash - II in the year 2014.

			<p>
			In the month of August that same year, I started my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from THDC
			Institute of Hydropower Engineering and Technology. The college is in the beautiful 
			city of Tehri in the Uttarakhand state.

			<p>My hobbies: reading about various kind of stuff like history, philosophy, Hinduism and a lot more things. 
			I'm a huge fan of electronic music. I like playing basketball.</p>

					I find it pretty hard to name any specific area from computer science as my favorite. Still I'll
					try to be a little more specific. I've always found <i>algorithms</i> interesting. I'm always 
				looking for some exciting algorithms from any field. <a href="algo.html">Some algorithms</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I studied <i>operating systems</i> in my 6th sem. I found that the ideas used to solve problems that arise
				in this field are very much related to real life (so are their solutions). Like, <i>how to share a limited resource among many 
				contenders</i>, <i>avoiding deadlocks</i>, and <i>giving (atleast an illusion) more from little</i>...Also 
				building an OS requires good knowledge of computer architecture and programming.
